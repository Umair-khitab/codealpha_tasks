# Iris Flower Classification 

This project is part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify Iris flowers into different species based on their physical measurements.

Project Overview
The Iris dataset contains measurements of flowers from three species:
- Setosa  
- Versicolor  
- Virginica  

Using these measurements, a classification model is trained to predict the species of a given flower.

 What I Did
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset  
- Checked for missing values and basic data information  
- Visualized relationships between features using pair plots  
- Split the data into training and testing sets  
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**  
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix  
- Tested the model on a custom flower sample to demonstrate real-world usage  

 Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

Results
The model achieved **100% accuracy** on the test dataset.  
This high accuracy is expected because the Iris dataset is clean and the classes are well separated, making it suitable for learning basic classification concepts.
